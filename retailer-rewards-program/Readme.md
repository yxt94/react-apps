Problem statement 

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, 
plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, 
calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

1. Use React JS (do not use TypeScript)
2. Simulate an asynchronous API call to fetch data
3. Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
4. Check solution into GitHub
